                    <h2>Making It</h2>

                    <p>
                        Making this webpage has been a blast. Making sure that the structure from the base index file and this one are similar is qoute easy to make by simply coping the base and pasting in the same folder or directory.

                        I realised that the first index I made and deleted open and close quotation marks still has resonance in the new file. I hope to understand why that is before handling the advanced project of html.

                        I wonder why uninstalling and reinstalling VS code doesn't seem to lose data from previous work.

                        I am a microbiology student in his final year, so what we learned in the first semester is virology, which is the study of biological virus. I wonder how are they different from computer virusses.
